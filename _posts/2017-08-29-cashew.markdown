Cashew scientific name anacardeum occidentale originally found in Brazil. Portuguese brought samplings to India during late 17th century. Cashew has come a long way and is one of the largest cash crops in India. India exports 17% of the world's cashew. We at Yashaswi Nursery use Bhaskara graft variety in Cashew.
